# 🌱 My First Web Design Project

Welcome to the **very first project** that marked the beginning of my web development journey!  
At the time, I only knew **HTML** and **CSS**, and I had no idea what good code looked like, how to name classes properly, what responsiveness meant, or even how to structure a webpage efficiently.

I was simply experimenting — driven by curiosity and the joy of creating something of my own.

## 💡 Why I'm Uploading This Now

I built this project long ago but never uploaded it.  
- Back then, I didn’t know how GitHub worked  
- Later, I completely forgot about this folder  
- Recently, I discovered it again — and I knew it deserved to be here ✨  

It’s not polished, not complete, not responsive… but it’s **real**. And it represents that beautiful moment when I decided to **start**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML (raw and unstructured)
- CSS (basic styling, no responsiveness)

---

## 📝 Highlights & Thoughts
- Didn’t know how to write “good code” or use proper class names
- Had no idea about responsive design or layout systems
- No media queries, no best practices — just trial, error, and heart ❤️
- This was my stepping stone — a foundation I’m proud of today
